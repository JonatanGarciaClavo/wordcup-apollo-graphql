## Purpose

Idea behind this project it is to do POC using GraphQl as backend system. Test possibilities and how to work with Apollo Client and how to interact and create a website with it.

For this project I used `https://worldcup-2018.now.sh/` endpoint that I founded when I read [How we built the 2018 World Cup GraphQL API](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-the-2018-world-cup-graphql-api-fab40ccecb9e)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the coverage mode.<br>

### `npm test:watch`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
